# REPOShock

**Mod to add PiShock Integration to R.E.P.O**

## Features
- Get Shocked for taking damage.
- Get Shocked for dying.
- Get Shocked for breaking items.
- Support for multiple shockers

I implemented a feature that allows you to use Valuable Objects as weapons without shocking you. After hitting an enemy with an Object, you have 3 seconds of grace before that object starts shocking you when it takes damage again.


## Usage
To use this, run the game at least once after installing to generate a config file

**DO NOT SHARE MODPACKS WITH THIS MOD CONFIGURED IN IT**
if you do, you will also be sharing your API key and sharecodes, which anyone you share that pack with will also get.
It is fine to share a pack that **doesn't** have config set, but if you set your config and share a pack, other people will get your private keys.

1. Open the Config file
2. Enter your PiShock API Key
3. Add a share code (or multiple, separated by commas)
4. Enter your desired config

That should be it! If you have issues, check the BepIn Console for more details.
